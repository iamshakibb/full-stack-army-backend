# Assignment 1 Tasks

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

- Subject: Make our algorithm live using REST API
- Description: Please select one or many algorithm ideas from the below list and create a rest api out of it -

  A. We have a function that can take two arguments called start and end. Both arguments will be a valid integer number. The function will return a random value in the given range.

  B. We have a function that can generate a fake person profile including first name, last name, email, avatar, age and address. User can pass an array of selected properties and it will return a person object containing only given properties. Ex: generatePerson([’firstName’, ‘lastName’, ‘email’])

  C. We have a function that can accept a string as an argument and return an object containing the number of letters, number of symbols and number of numeric characters.

- You must have to keep business logic and API logic separate.
